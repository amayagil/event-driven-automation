# Introducing Ansible Event Driven Automation

This repo shows a simple demo to showcase event driven automation using ansible and rulebooks.

The rulebook instantiates three different listeners: Kafka, Alertmanager and a simple Webhook listener

Each of those listeners react to events, either greeting the caller (Kafka/webhook) or trying to remediate to an alert triggered by the application via playbooks that are part of the demo.

Events are generated by a Quarkus application, listening on port *8080* on localhost, that exposes the following endpoints

    /alertmanager/greeting
    /kafka/greeting
    /webhook/greeting

## Requirements

To run the demo, **podman** and **podman-compose** should be installed in your system. Yes, nothing more :)

Follow the instructions to install them, based on your system.

[Podman setup](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)

[podman-compose setup](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose)

## Components

The stack is composed by four containers:

- Kafka+zookeeper container to instantiate the broker
- Alertmanager container to set-up an alertmanager instance
- Quarkus-client container that will act as an event generator
- Ansible EDA container image, running the ansible bits

The *eda-ansible* directory, all rulebooks and playbooks are present.
The *eda-quarkus-tester* directory contains the source code for the quarkus client

A pre-built **podman-compose.yml** is present in the repo to allow a quick setup of the kafka/alertmanager/quarkus stack.

## Usage

Start your stack by issuing:

    podman-compose -d up

After all services started, you can now start your ansible container via:

    podman run -it --name ansible -v ./eda-ansible:/eda-ansible:Z -n eda-ansible quay.io/kubealex/eda-ansible

For demo purposes, we are starting it in interactive mode, so you can follow the logs during executions.

To test the services, you can call the following endpoints, where the Quarkus application is listening and will generate events accordingly:

    curl localhost:8080/alertmanager/greeting
    curl localhost:8080/webhook/greeting
    curl localhost:8080/kafka/greeting

A sample output after an event is captured by the event listener is below:

    INFO:ansible_rulebook.builtin:ruleset: Listen for events on multiple sources (Kafka, Webhook, AlertManager), rule: Let Ansible print information about the alert
    INFO:ansible_rulebook.builtin:Calling Ansible runner
